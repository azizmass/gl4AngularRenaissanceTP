The @Input decorator in Angular is used to define a property in a child component that receives data from a parent component. This property is bound to the value passed from the parent, and Angular's change detection ensures the value is updated when it changes.

Input signals are a new feature introduced in Angular 16, leveraging the reactivity of Signals to improve state management and data flow. Signals are a built-in mechanism to manage state reactively, and when combined with input properties, they provide a more efficient and predictable way to handle input changes.

The change detection cycle is a process in Angular where the framework checks for changes in the state of components and updates the DOM accordingly.

How It Works:

Angular runs a zone-based mechanism to detect state changes.
It traverses the component tree and compares the current values of bindings with their previous values (dirty checking).
When a change is detected, Angular updates the DOM and recalculates the view.
Characteristics:

Triggered By: Events like user interactions, HTTP responses, timers (setTimeout, setInterval), or other asynchronous tasks.
Granularity: Checks the entire component tree during each cycle.
Performance Implication: Can be inefficient in large applications because all components are checked, even if most of them havenâ€™t changed.

Reactivity refers to a programming model where state changes are automatically propagated to dependent parts of the application without the need for explicit checks or cycles.

How It Works:

Reactive systems track dependencies explicitly (e.g., signals, observables).
When a dependency changes, only the parts of the application relying on that specific state are updated.
Characteristics:

Triggered By: Changes in state explicitly tracked by the reactive system (e.g., signals, observables).
Granularity: Updates only the components or views that depend on the changed state.
Performance Implication: More efficient than change detection as it avoids unnecessary checks.
